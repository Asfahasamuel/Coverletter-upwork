My professional experience includes bringing the UX designer's wireframes to life with HTML5 and CSS3, as well as collaborating with Back End Developers to create an outstanding final product. I believe my abilities and experience qualify me to be your worker.
Here are some of my most important credentials and achievements:
•	Three years of expertise as a Front End Developer on numerous projects.
•	HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript were used to create different website features.
•	Designed and implemented project scope and deadlines using the design-develop-deploy methodology.
•	Collaborated with UX designers and Back End Developers to guarantee that all parties were on the same page.
•	Prototypes of features were tested for flaws and user experience.
I understand how essential details are to a Front End Developer. My keen attention to detail and commitment to solving any issue at hand set me apart from other candidates with comparable qualifications. If you think I'd be a good match for your project, I'd be happy to set up an interview at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely, Samuel Asfaha
